i didnt see the frog for the rest of the day maybe it stayed in miss weavers hair or maybe it jumped back through the window when i wasnt looking all day long i expected her to find it and let out a scream but she never did when the bell rang i ran out of the school onto the side of the grass that had the most bushes i had seen frogs hide in there before but there was no sign of any truthfully i wouldnt have known what to do with the frog if i had found it would i capture it would i ask it questions if i was caught talking to a frog outside the school i think people might finally start to remember me but in a donttalktothefrogkid kind of way i liked most of the kids in my class just fine but i was only really close with one his name was soy and he was definitely without a doubt my best friend soy had kind of reddishblond hair and a round face he and i had been friends since preschool and i knew that i could talk to him about anything the downside to that was that he also felt he could talk to me about anything since he had eight older brothers and two older sisters his questions were always about things that i didnt understand and didnt want to heres how it would usually go soys brothers would talk about older kids things and then make fun of him for not getting it he would ask me about it and wed look it up it only took a few google searches for me to get banned from using the internet with soy the bottom line was that if i was going to tell anyone about the frog it would be soy i decided that our walk home would be the best chance did you see anything outside today during math i asked soy as we started walking what do you mean on the grass he asked jumping over cracks in the sidewalk i mean right outside the window like right up against it i answered like a person he asked still hopping soy sat in the row farthest from the window so it wouldve been possible but still weird for someone to walk by without him noticing no its more like i saw a frog up against the window i explained awesome he said yeah but it wasnt a normal frog it opened the window and it came in the classroom and jumped on miss weavers shoulder and it jumped inside her hair i spit out soy stopped jumping and looked at me that happened today he asked yeah i mean im pretty sure and when i thought i might be making it up the frog nodded at me i said soy looked confused i thought i heard something move in the tree above us but soy answered before i could look it nodded at you i dont even think frogs have necks do they said soy this one did i guess i mean most frogs dont wear glasses either but it had those too i explained all of a sudden soy seemed a couple steps further away the frog was wearing glasses he asked suspiciously yes i shot back why would someone go around putting glasses on frogs he asked i dunno maybe it bought them on its own i replied soy was standing at least ten steps away now right well maybe miss weaver will let us look in her hair tomorrow and we can ask the frog where it got em so i think im just gonna head back home today instead of coming over my mom has lots of stuff for me to do see you later soy said turning to run away soy i yelled stop right there i can prove the frog is real oh yeah how he asked with an eye roll its sitting on your backpack i

: 3. The Treehouse. \nSoy had the frog in his hands within seconds. He was always good with outdoorsy stuff like that. His mom was usually busy with his siblings, so Soy was left to play outside a lot. By third grade, he had caught a pet turtle, salamander, and flying squirrel. Unfortunately, his older brothers Rick and Hank stole the squirrel and kept it in their room. Once a week they played a game where Rick threw the squirrel from the second story window, and Hank caught it midair with a trash can as it glided down. Soy tried to get them to stop, but they never listened. It wasn’t until a particularly windy fall day that he caught a gust and flew over their heads to freedom.\n\n\tThe frog didn’t put up much of a fight. I started to wonder if it actually wanted to be caught. \n\n\t“Do you believe me now?” I asked.\n \tSoy peaked inside his hands, and then lifted his head with wide eyes. \"Well… this frog is wearing glasses. I’ll give you that.”\n\n\tBoth of our minds were racing with questions. \n \t“Let’s bring it to my treehouse, so we can figure this out,” I said. \n\n\tI had built most of the treehouse in my backyard myself. My mom and dad insisted on one of them being there when I used certain tools, but that was about it. Building things always made me feel good afterwards, and I had gotten pretty good at it. The treehouse had been done for a while, but there were still a few things I wanted to add to it before winter.  \n\n\tWhen we got there, I told Soy to use the elevator. It was really just a rope with a weighted pulley system, but I called it the elevator anyway. We used it when we needed to carry things that we couldn’t bring up on the ladder. I climbed up and then lowered it down for him. All those years of critter-handling had paid off, and he got it inside the treehouse without any problem. I shut the door and quadruple-locked it, so that the frog couldn’t run away (and also to give us some privacy). \n\n\t“Okay, Soy,” I said, \"let him loose.\" \n\n\tSoy lowered his hands and opened them, letting the frog hop to the floor of the treehouse. I had a small drafting table, drawings, and bits of wood all over, which provided plenty of places for the frog to hide. Luckily for us, it didn’t move at all. \n\n\tInstead it looked up at me, and in a loud voice said, “What do you mean, ‘him’?”\n \tSoy fell backwards from a crouch onto his rear. The frog was looking right at me, waiting for an answer, but all I could do was shake my head.\n \t\"It’s rude to assume I’m a ‘he’, don’t you think? I happen to be a girl,” said the frog proudly. Soy was now holding his head with both hands. \n\n\t“It can talk!!” he said in disbelief.\n \t\"Calling me an ‘it’, after I just told you I was a girl, is just plain inconsiderate, Soy!” she insisted.\n\n\tI knelt down closer, looking for anything that might make sense of it all. Maybe the frog was a robot? But nothing about the way it moved was robotic. And would a “Made in China” sticker really make me feel better? It… she… had just called my best friend by his first name! Soy was so flabbergasted that he was gnawing on his backpack strap, so I doubted that they had met before. \n\n\t“I’m sorry,” I said to the frog, kneeling down, “we didn’t mean anything by it. Truly.”\n \tThe frog hopped even closer and said, “You’ve always been kind.” Then she whispered, “It’s a powerful thing. Remember that.”\n \t“I will,” I said, amazed that I had just gone from meeting a talking frog to taking advice from a talking frog in a matter of seconds. \n\n\t“But, um, if you don’t mind me asking, how is it that you can talk?” I said. \n\n\tBy that point Soy had half of the backpack strap in his mouth. \n\n\tThe frog crooked her head at me slightly. “Do you think that humans are the only animals that can talk?” she asked. \n\n\tI was startled. Was it possible that animals could talk, and somehow no one in the world knew about it? Was everything that I thought about animals wrong? I took a seat on the floor, too. Soy spit out his strap. \n\n\t\"That’s not okay,” he said. “I tell my pet iguana all of my secrets. If he can talk, I need to know who he’s been talking to.”\n \tThe frog gave out a little laugh, then she said, “Oh, I’m just kidding. Animals can’t talk any more than humans can flap their arms and fly.” \n\n\tI was embarrassed, but mostly relieved. \n\n\t“What about some kind of iguana sign language?” asked Soy, still nervous. \n\n\tIgnoring Soy's question, I asked the frog, “How is it that you can? Talk, I mean.\" \n\n\t“For starters, I’m not a frog,” she explained. “The only reason that I—” \n\n\tWithout any warning, there was a knock on my treehouse door. \n\n\t“What are you up to in there? Why is this door closed?” asked my mom sternly.\n \tI searched my brain for an answer that didn’t have the word frog in it. \n\n\t“Soy and I were, um, we were doing homework, and the breeze kept blowing our papers away.\" I replied.\n \t“He’s a clever one” the frog whispered to Soy. \n\n\tI gave the frog a signal to be quiet. It may have been the first time in the history of the world that one had spoken, but for the time being, she needed to stop. If my mom heard a girl’s voice, I was worried she might break through the door again. She had a habit of doing that any time something seemed suspicious. It was only a week before that she had seen the smoke from one of Soy’s firecrackers and broken through three locks. I added the fourth the next day, but it was becoming clear to me that metal was no match for “mom strength”. So, for the moment, I needed this frog’s vocabulary to shrink back down to “ribbit”. \n\n\t“Well, come on inside the house. There’s a man from the school board here who needs to speak with you.” She lowered her voice and spoke softly into the crack of the door. “He looks pretty official. He’s got a fancy suit and a shiny yellow bowtie. Don’t worry though, he told me me you’ve done nothing wrong.” \n\n\t“Yellow?!” screeched the frog.\n \t“What was that, honey?”\n \t“Oh… I said, ‘Hello!’” I lied, using the best high-pitched voice I could muster.\n \t“Honey, ‘Hello’ usually comes at the beginning of conversations. We’re pretty far into this one,” she answered.\n \t“Ah, right. I just sometimes forget when you’re supposed to say it,” I replied nervously. \n\n\t“Oh… I didn’t realize. Maybe we can work on that, sweetie,” she said, closer to the door than ever. “Because that’s definitely a problem. Just hurry up and come down, please.” \n\n\tI heard my mom climb down the ladder, then watched her go back inside the house through the sliding back door. The frog jumped up onto the open treehouse window in a panic. I was amazed at how high she could jump, and knew at that moment that she could have left any time that she had wanted. \n\n\t“Whatever you do, don’t mention me,” the frog whispered frantically. “I’ll find you later.” \n\n\tAnd with that, she jumped out the window into a bush below.\n\nAprès : 3 the treehouse soy had the frog in his hands within seconds he was always good with outdoorsy stuff like that his mom was usually busy with his siblings so soy was left to play outside a lot by third grade he had caught a pet turtle salamander and flying squirrel unfortunately his older brothers rick and hank stole the squirrel and kept it in their room once a week they played a game where rick threw the squirrel from the second story window and hank caught it midair with a trash can as it glided down soy tried to get them to stop but they never listened it wasn’t until a particularly windy fall day that he caught a gust and flew over their heads to freedom the frog didn’t put up much of a fight i started to wonder if it actually wanted to be caught “do you believe me now” i asked soy peaked inside his hands and then lifted his head with wide eyes well… this frog is wearing glasses i’ll give you that” both of our minds were racing with questions “let’s bring it to my treehouse so we can figure this out” i said i had built most of the treehouse in my backyard myself my mom and dad insisted on one of them being there when i used certain tools but that was about it building things always made me feel good afterwards and i had gotten pretty good at it the treehouse had been done for a while but there were still a few things i wanted to add to it before winter when we got there i told soy to use the elevator it was really just a rope with a weighted pulley system but i called it the elevator anyway we used it when we needed to carry things that we couldn’t bring up on the ladder i climbed up and then lowered it down for him all those years of critterhandling had paid off and he got it inside the treehouse without any problem i shut the door and quadruplelocked it so that the frog couldn’t run away and also to give us some privacy “okay soy” i said let him loose soy lowered his hands and opened them letting the frog hop to the floor of the treehouse i had a small drafting table drawings and bits of wood all over which provided plenty of places for the frog to hide luckily for us it didn’t move at all instead it looked up at me and in a loud voice said “what do you mean ‘him’” soy fell backwards from a crouch onto his rear the frog was looking right at me waiting for an answer but all i could do was shake my head it’s rude to assume i’m a ‘he’ don’t you think i happen to be a girl” said the frog proudly soy was now holding his head with both hands “it can talk” he said in disbelief calling me an ‘it’ after i just told you i was a girl is just plain inconsiderate soy” she insisted i knelt down closer looking for anything that might make sense of it all maybe the frog was a robot but nothing about the way it moved was robotic and would a “made in china” sticker really make me feel better it… she… had just called my best friend by his first name soy was so flabbergasted that he was gnawing on his backpack strap so i doubted that they had met before “i’m sorry” i said to the frog kneeling down “we didn’t mean anything by it truly” the frog hopped even closer and said “you’ve always been kind” then she whispered “it’s a powerful thing remember that” “i will” i said amazed that i had just gone from meeting a talking frog to taking advice from a talking frog in a matter of seconds “but um if you don’t mind me asking how is it that you can talk” i said by that point soy had half of the backpack strap in his mouth the frog crooked her head at me slightly “do you think that humans are the only animals that can talk” she asked i was startled was it possible that animals could talk and somehow no one in the world knew about it was
